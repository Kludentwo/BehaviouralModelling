\chapter{Conclusion}
In this study the book "the physics of foraging"\cite{viswanathan2011the} has been read. The book provides an insight into behavioural modelling along with the statistical modelling that the models build upon.\\
Two data generators have been implemented in order to work with parameter estimation. Two parameter estimators have been implemented whereas one will not be used for further work. Methods to present the data from the generators along with the distribution found by using the estimated parameters have been implemented.\\
An overall insight into behavioural models and statistics have been acquired in this study.\\
