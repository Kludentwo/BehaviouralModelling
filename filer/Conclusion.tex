\chapter{Conclusion}
In this project a least squares solver has been implemented using High-Level Synthesis. Using the Vivado HLS tool, different directives has been applied and the effect analysed and used for comparison. With a starting point in the unoptimised implementation, it was possible to reduce the latency in the design at the expense of higher resource requirement. Likewise it was possible to reduce the resource requirement at the expense of higher latency. The Vivado HLS tool also uses iterative optimisation when synthesising the design to RTL.

The development in the project was made easier by the Vivado HLS tool. The tool provides an environment for faster development compared to designing and implementing using lower abstraction layers. The technology will still need to be adapted by researchers and developers as it not very mature yet.
