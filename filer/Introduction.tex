\chapter{Introduction}
The goal of this report is researching some of the uses for high level synthesis. An example problem from another course will be used as basis for the research and methods acquired in this course will be applied to the problem. A Comparison of the different methods will be presented with regards to relevant measurements.

A series of questions will be explored and answered in the case study. These questions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item What are optimisation directives in High-Level synthesis?
\item How are they used and to what effect?
\end{itemize}
To answer these questions a small subset of the optimisation directives are chosen and applied to the aforementioned example problem. 

The overall purpose of the report is described in the course catalogue as these points:
\begin{itemize}
\item Define and explain concepts, methods and technologies relating to the chosen subject area.
\item Give an account of research articles relevant to the subject area.
\item Account for the status and application of the subject area.
\item Prepare a report and an oral presentation on the subject area.
\end{itemize}
