\chapter{Introduction}
The goal of this report is researching some of the behavioural models used in foraging. The basis of the models and how they are used for determining behaviour is obtained from the book "Physics of Foraging"\cite{viswanathan2011the}.

Using the knowledge acquired from the book and additional papers a small project will be conducted with respect to the following bullet points:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement a data generator
\item Generate data
\item Implement parameter estimator for distribution parameters
\item Present the empirical data and the true distribution 
\end{itemize}

The overall purpose of the report can be described as these points:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introductory look at distributions and modelling statistics.
\item Insight into behavioural modelling.
\item Better understanding of master thesis.
\end{itemize}

The study will take place over the course of 7 weeks. 3 weeks are devoted to reading and understanding basic principles of the book. 4 weeks are devoted to researching and implementing a simulation.
