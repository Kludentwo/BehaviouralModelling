\chapter{Discussion}
The naive fitted distribution method is a very simple way to find know alpha values. 
The method relies upon being able to sweep through alpha values. 
If the other parameters need to be estimated further sweeps are needed, increasing the complexity of the method. 
The method also relies upon an intrinsic knowledge of the dataset. 
For this reason the method is discarded.\\
The log|S$\alpha$S| method is more reliable when it comes detecting the characteristic exponent, $\alpha$ and the scale parameter, $\gamma$. Table \ref{tab:resalpha} shows the little percentile error in this method with regards to the estimated alpha.\\
With respect to fitting the distribution and histogram some metrics have been acquired. In order to estimate the boundaries for the characteristic function the limits must be  $\geq 1 + \alpha$. A scalefactor (not related to the characteristic function) is also applied to the fourier transform to smooth the distribution curve and remove any bias.\\

%den naive metode kan kun finde alpha. Og dette kun i tilpas store spring. Hvis den skal kunne gamma også ville det kræve en del mere sweeping.

%Den anden kan både alpha og gamma.
